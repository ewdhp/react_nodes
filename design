1. Imports and Setup
Imports React, ReactFlow, custom components, and helpers.
Defines initial empty arrays for nodes and edges.
2. HighlightNode
A wrapper for nodes that visually highlights the selected node.
3. Component State
Manages state for nodes, edges, UI toggles 
(log, hotkeys, structure menu, editor), 
selection, undo/redo history, and rectangle selection.
4. Keyboard Shortcuts (Hotkeys)
Uses useEffect to add global keyboard listeners for:
Toggling log pane (Ctrl+Alt+L)
Toggling code editor (Ctrl+Alt+C)
Undo/redo (Ctrl+Z/Ctrl+Y)
Save/load graph (Ctrl+S/Ctrl+O)
Show/hide hotkeys overlay (Ctrl+Alt+H)
Toggle structure menu (Ctrl+Alt+M)
Structure menu navigation (arrow keys, enter, escape)
Node/edge deletion, deselection, and copy
5. Node and Edge Management
Functions for updating node data, moving nodes, updating edges, 
connecting nodes, and deleting edges.
6. Selection and Multi-Selection
Handles node selection (single/multi with Ctrl/Shift), deselection, 
and rectangle selection (drag to select multiple nodes).
7. Structure Menu
The left-side menu (now a separate StructureMenu component) allows 
users to apply graph layouts (e.g., vertical, horizontal) to the nodes.
Keyboard navigation for this menu is handled in the hotkey handler.
8. Node Editing
Double-clicking a node (handled in the Node component) allows renaming.
The right pane shows a Monaco code editor for the selected nodeâ€™s script.
9. Rendering
The main layout is a flexbox with:
The graph and overlays on the left
The code editor for the selected node (or the log pane if no node 
is selected) on the right
10. Other Features
Undo/redo history for nodes and edges.
Copy/paste for selected nodes and their edges.
Keyboard navigation for the structure menu and hotkeys overlay.
Summary:
The component provides a visual graph editor with keyboard shortcuts, 
multi-selection, undo/redo, structure layouts, and a code editor 
for each node. The flow is modular, with state and handlers for 
each major feature, and UI split into logical panes and overlays.
